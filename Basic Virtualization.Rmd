## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r price histogram}
# Histogram for Price
ggplot(properties_dataset, aes(x = Price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500000, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Price", x = "Price", y = "Frequency")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
# Scatter plot for Price vs. Covered Area
ggplot(properties_dataset, aes(x = `Covered Area`, y = Price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Price vs. Covered Area", x = "Covered Area", y = "Price")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
